        <p>
            Iâ€™m currently a Bachelor student at the Faculty of Natural Sciences. Iâ€™ve always been interested in technology and how things work behind the scenes, which led me to start learning programming.
            Even though Iâ€™m still gaining experience, I enjoy working on small projects and learning by doing. Iâ€™m especially interested in web development and love building things that people can interact with.
        
            Some of the technologies Iâ€™ve been using are <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, and <strong>CSS</strong>. Iâ€™m also exploring new tools and frameworks to improve my skills.
      
            My goal is to keep learning and growing as a developer, and eventually work on real-world projects where I can turn ideas into useful applications.
